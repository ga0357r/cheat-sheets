# [Grokking Coding Interview Patterns in C#](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-coding-interview-in-csharp)

## Two Pointers
Used on sequential data structures like arrays or linkedlists. it involves maintaining two pointers that traverse the data structure in a coordinated manner, typically starting from different positions or moving in opposite directions. 

These pointers dynamically adjust based on specific conditions or criteria, allowing for the efficient exploration of the data and enabling solutions with optimal time and space complexity.

Whenever thereâ€™s a requirement to find two data elements in an array that satisfy a certain condition, the two pointers pattern should be the first strategy to come to mind.

### Is Valid Palindrome
```
using System;

public class Solution {
    public static bool IsPalindrome(string s) {

        // Replace this placeholder return statement with your code
        //abcca
        int start = 0;
        int end = s.Length - 1;
        
        while(start <= end)
        {
          if(s[start] != s[end])
          {
            return false;
          }
          
          start++;
          end--;
        }
        
        
        return true;
    }
}

```

        {
            int low = current+1;

### Introduction to Graphs
A graph is a nonlinear data structure that represents connections between entities. In graph theory, entities are represented as vertices (or nodes), and the connections between them are expressed through edges.

Undirected Graphs - 2-way relationship
Directed Graph - 1-way relationship
Weighted Graph - a cost or measure is associated with each edge
Cyclic Graph - a graph that contains at least 1 cycle. A -> B -> C -> A 
Acyclic Graph - a graph that contains no cycle.

For graph related coding questions, an adjacency list or matrix will be provided. **Breadth First Search(BFS) and Depth First Search(DFS) are graph traversal techniques**.

In **DFS**, the strategy is to explore  as far as possible along one path before turning back. Visit all nodes and neighbours marking them as visited. Once a node with no neighbours are found, the algorithms starts backtracking. In backtacking, the algorithm  goes one step back and checks for the remaining neighbour nodes that are yet to be explored, this continues until all nodes reacheable from the source node has been visited.

**The DFS algorithm can be implemented with a Stack**.  Initialize an empty stack and choose a source node, push it onto the stack, and mark it as visited. While the stack is not empty, pop a node, explore its unvisited neighbors, and push them onto the stack, marking them as visited. Continue this process until reaching a node with no unvisited neighbors, then backtrack by popping from the stack. Repeat until the stack is empty, ensuring all connected nodes are visited.

In **BFS**, the strategy is to explore the graph in layers, one level at a time. The algorithm begins at a chosen source node and visits all its immediate neighbor nodes while marking them as visited. It then moves on to visit the neighbors of those nodes before proceeding to the next level of neighbors. This process continues until all the nodes in the graph, that are reachable from the source node, have been visited.

The **BFS** algorithm can be implemented with a queue.  Initialize an empty queue and choose a source node, enqueue it, and then enter a loop. Within this loop, the algorithm dequeues a node from the front of the queue, visits its immediate neighbors, and marks them as visited. These neighbors are subsequently enqueued into the queue. The queue plays a crucial role in determining the order of exploration, ensuring that nodes at the current level are processed before progressing to the next. This iterative process continues until the queue is empty, signifying that all reachable nodes from the source have been visited.

Traversals can be used to find paths, cycles, or connected components within graphs. However, when aiming for specific objectives, such as determining the shortest path rather than any path, or identifying the minimum spanning tree instead of connected components, traversals can be adapted to address particular optimization problems associated with the graph.

There are various algorithms that help us solve these specific graph problems. Letâ€™s go over a few:

**Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm**: Itâ€™s a variation of DFS and finds the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.

**Bellman-Ford algorithm**: Itâ€™s a variation of BFS and finds the shortest paths in a weighted graph, even when negative edge weights are present.

**Floyd-Warshall algorithm**: Itâ€™s a variation of BFS and finds the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph.

**Topological sorting**: Itâ€™s similar to DFS and orders nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to satisfy dependencies.

**Primâ€™s algorithm**: It finds the minimum spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph.

**Kruskalâ€™s algorithm**: It also finds the minimum spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph.

Any problem with relationships between elements: There is a network of interconnected objects with some relationship between them; that is, the data can be represented as a graph.

Many problems in the real world use the graphs pattern. Letâ€™s look at some examples.

Routing in computer networks: The graph representation helps to visualize the computer network, where nodes represent devices such as computers or servers and edges signify connections. Then, graph algorithms such as Dijkstraâ€™s can be used to find the shortest and optimal path between any computer and the server. This is to ensure that data travels quickly from our computer to a faraway server on the internet without getting stuck or slowed down.

Flight route optimization: Airlines use graph-based algorithms to optimize flight routes. The airport network can be represented as a graph, where nodes represent airports, and edges represent flights connecting them. The algorithms can be used to find the shortest route between two airports, reduce fuel consumption, and minimize flight time.

Epidemic spread modeling: Graph algorithms can be used to predict how a virus might spread in a community. Imagine people as nodes and their interactions as edges. Algorithms simulate how a virus could move through these connections to help plan prevention strategies.

Recommendation systems: Online streaming services such as Netflix suggest movies we might like based on what weâ€™ve watched using graph algorithms. Imagine all the movies and viewers as nodes, with edges connecting similar movies or people who like the same things. Graph algorithms then analyze these connections, finding patterns. If people who liked the same movies as we did also liked other movies we havenâ€™t seen, the algorithm suggests those new movies to us. Itâ€™s like having a friend who knows our taste in movies and recommends something they think weâ€™ll love based on what weâ€™ve enjoyed before.
