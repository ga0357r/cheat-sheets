# Google Kubernetes Engine(GKE)
(GKE) is a service that allows you to use managed Kubernetes clusters for deploying and managing the operation of containerized applications on Google Cloud's infrastructure.

A GKE environment consists of VMs grouped together to form a cluster. Apps are packaged into containers and the kubernetes API is used to interact with the app.

It is recommended to run GKE in autopilot mode so the control plane and worker nodes are automatically managed

## GKE Cluster Architecture
When a GKE cluster is created, two types of components are automatically built: control plane (master node) and nodes (worker nodes).

### control plane (master node)
The control plane for a GKE cluster is created within a managed VPC in Google Cloud, and there is no burden on users to build or operate it.

### nodes (worker nodes)
A cluster contains one or more nodes that run workloads.
In a GKE cluster, nodes are configured by Compute Engine instances and are automatically created during cluster creation.
Auto-healing is enabled by default on nodes and performs periodic health checks on each node in the cluster.

## Ingress
Ingress is a Kubernetes API resource that provides L7 load balancing for workloads within a Kubernetes cluster.

## Use cases for GKE
- AI and ML operations
- Data processing at scale
- Scalable online games platforms
- Reliable applications under heavy load

## Get Started with GKE
### Before you begin
1) Create a Google cloud account
2) Create a Google cloud project
3) Make sure billing is enabled for google cloud project.
4) Enabled artifact registry and kubernetes and kubernetes engine api

### Launch Cloud Shell
1) Go to Google Cloud Console
2) Click activate Cloud Shell Button on the upper right corner of the console.
3) Set default project in Google cloud CLI with "gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID "
