# Google Kubernetes Engine(GKE)?
(GKE) is a service that allows you to use managed Kubernetes clusters for deploying and managing the operation of containerized applications on Google Cloud's infrastructure.

## GKE Cluster Architecture
When a GKE cluster is created, two types of components are automatically built: control plane (master node) and nodes (worker nodes).

### control plane (master node)
The control plane for a GKE cluster is created within a managed VPC in Google Cloud, and there is no burden on users to build or operate it.

### nodes (worker nodes)
A cluster contains one or more nodes that run workloads.
In a GKE cluster, nodes are configured by Compute Engine instances and are automatically created during cluster creation.
Auto-healing is enabled by default on nodes and performs periodic health checks on each node in the cluster.
