# Multiplayer Game Networking Architecting Networked Games by Joshua Glazier and Sanjay Madhav
Always write down the following: note, tip, warning. Optionally, I can write down the sidebar. You can find the companion website [here](https://github.com/MultiplayerBook/MultiplayerBook). 
## Overview of Networked Games
Multiplayer game architecture overview of Age of Empires, and Starsiege: Tribes. Also discussing the challenges of engineering a networked multiplayer game. 

Brief History of Computer Games
- Local Multiplayer Games: Were player on a single computer with split screen. Similar to single player games. Examples are Tennis for Two(1958) and Spacewar!(1962).

- Early Networked Multiplayer Games: SImilar to a Local Area network. Using a serial port(allowing a bit of data to be transmitted at a time). A daisy chain scheme meant more than 1 computer was connected at once

- Multi User Dungeon(MUD): multiple users connect to a virtual world at once. Some MUD  games were ran on a bulletin board system using modems

- Local Area Network(LAN) Games: several computers connected to each other over a relatively small area. LANs really took off with the proliferation of the ethernet. DOOM 1993 was the progenitor of modern networked games supporting up to 4 players in a single game session

- Online Games: players connect over some large network with geographically distant computers. In the late 1990s online games like id Software's Quake(1996) and Epic Game's Unreal (1998) took off. The major consideration when working with online games is latency.
