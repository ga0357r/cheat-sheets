# Internet

**'Internet'** is a large network of computers connected together. **'Servers'** are specialized computers connected to the internet. **'Webpages'** are files which exist on the server . **'IP Addresses'** help computers find each other. **'Personal Computers(PCs)'** are not servers directly because they connect to an **'Internet Service Provider (ISP)'**. Whenever data travels through the internet, they are broken down into **'packets'**. 

**'Data centers'** use fibre optic cables to connect to each continent. ISP gives an IP address to your device.  **'Domain names'** link to an ip address. The internet uses **'Domain Name Service (DNS)'** as a phone book for domain name and ip address. **'ICANN'** manages ip address assignment and domain name registration for the internet.
